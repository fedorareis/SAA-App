### Section 1: Project Goals and Use Cases
For a more detailed overview of the system and it's requirements, please refer to the [Software Requirements Specification][SRS]

The Sense and Avoid Application is a program framework to analyze the effectiveness of data correlation algorithms. The application consists of three standalone programs.

##### The Test Server
The ```test-server``` application provides a program to generate sensor data for several types of sensors (TCAS, ADS-B, RADAR) from a test case specification. The test server also handles analyzing and verifying the results of correlation, allowing the correlation tests to run without having to manually validate the correlation algorithm.

##### The SAA Application
The ```saa-application``` models a UAV in an airspace. The application reads in simulated airspace data, and outputs an approximate view of the airspace using a correlation algorithm. The saa-application is the main interest of the whole SAA application.

##### The CDTI
The ```cdti``` application provides a simple graphical view into the current simulation state. The CDTI is meant to help in debugging the simulation, as well as providing a more understandable look into the end result of the correlation algorithm. The CDTI does not need to be running, and is an optional component.

#### Use Cases
The major use case for the Saa Application is to provide a framework for analyzing, testing, and comparing correlation algorithms. Most research work with the application will occur in the saa-application. The test server and CDTI provide tools for analyzing the research done.

#### Target Users
The target users for Version 0.1.0 A are testers, and team members. This version is not meant as a public release, but an early preview to ensure that the software runs successfully. Several large features are missing from this release, the most glaring being a good correlation algorithm.

### Section 2: Installation and Dependencies 
To download project dependencies and build the application, run ```./build.sh``` from the home folder.

 > Note, this script is still in early alpha. If you experience problems, please contact the project maintainers with your error log.
 
The SAA application relies on the following dependencies:

* [CMake][cmake] (Ver 2.8.12 +) to handle building the application
* [QT5][qt] for displaying the CDTI
* [Google Protocol Buffers][protobuf] (Ver 3.0.0) to handle encoding and decoding messages between each component of the application.
* [MLPack][mlpack] provides some of the base methods used in our clustering techniques.
   *   MLPack depends on the following:
   *    Armadillo     >= 4.100.0
   *    Boost (program_options, math_c99, unit_test_framework, serialization)
  
* [GoogleTest][gtest] allows us to test our application, and write mock objects.

 Once the system is built, Unit tests can be run by running ```test-all```

### Section 3: Running the system
 
 For a basic run of the system, run ```app/test-server```, then ```app/saa-application```. from the build folder The application will load a default test case, and begin simulating data.
 
 To specify a test case, run the command ```test-server <test case>```, where test case is the path to a properly formatted XML test case. 
 
 At any point during a simulation, you may also run the program ```app/cdti``` to view the current state of the simulation on a display.
 
### Section 4: System Architecture
 This section is provided as a quick reference of the major components of the system. It is meant to help a new team member get quickly acquainted with the structure of the program.

The SAA Application is broken up into four major modules, found in the ```src``` folder. ```common```, ```cdti```, ```saa-application``` and ```test-server```.

The Common folder contains functions and classes used across all three sub-applications of the project, including the networking code, and some plane math.

The other three submodules contain support classes for their sub-applications. Correlation and decision making code exists in  ```saa-application```, Test case code exists in ```test-server```, and graphics code exists in ```cdti```

The main methods for each application exist in the top level ```app``` directory.

A third top level directory, ```test``` contains unit tests.

### Section 5: Build issue FAQ
Weâ€™ve had a few issues with the build process due to the difficulty of wrangling C++ dependencies. If you have run ```build.sh``` and are having trouble building the project, try these steps:

1. On OSX: use Homebrew to install the following dependencies:
 ```brew install homebrew/science/armadillo
 brew install boost
 brew install qt5
 brew install autoconf
 brew install automake
 brew install libtool```

2. On Linux:
 ```sudo apt-get install libarmadillo-dev libboost-all-dev qtdeclarative5-dev autoconf automake libtool```

3. Re-run ```cmake ..``` from the build folder, then ```make```.

4. If all else fails, please contact the project maintainer at kpidding@calpoly.edu.

### Section 6: Test Case Documentation
Below is an example Test Case from the application. Test cases are a standard xml document. More examples of test cases can be found under ```resources/testCases```.

    <test name="Two Planes Crossing"
      description="The two planes approach each other, but remain seperate correlations"
      time = "120"
      sensorError="false">

    <ownship tag="ABC123">
        <tcas enabled="true" error="1.5"/>
        <radar enabled="true"/>
        <ads-b enabled="true" error="0.2"/>
        <movement type="linear">
            <position x="0" y="0" z="0"/>
            <direction x="200" y="0" z="0"/>
        </movement>
    </ownship>
    
    <plane tag="N11111">
        <ads-b enabled="true"/>
        <tcas enabled="true"/>
        <movement type="linear">
            <position x="-2" y="10" z="0.3"/> <!--NED in Nautical Miles-->
            <direction x="800" y="0" z="0"/> <!--Feet/second-->
        </movement>
    </plane>
    
    <plane tag="N22222">
        <ads-b enabled="true"/>
        <tcas enabled="true"/>
        <movement type="linear">
            <position x="2" y="14" z="0.3"/> <!--NED in Nautical Miles-->
            <direction x="-800" y="300" z="0"/> <!--Feet/second-->
        </movement>
    </plane>
    </test>

The basic structure of a test case is:

    <test name = ""
          description = string
          time = number
          sensorError = bool
        <ownship tag = "">
            <Sensor tags>
            <Movement tag>
         </ownship>
         <plane tag = "">
            <Sensor options>
            <Movement option>
         ...
         </plane>
    </test>
