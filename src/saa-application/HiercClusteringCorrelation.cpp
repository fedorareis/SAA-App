   /* Helen's observation
    *
    * Few useful functions
    * Printing .t() prints the values in table format
    * .n_rows actually gives the number of columns which is 3 all the time
    * .n_cols gives the number of rows, which I think is size-1?
    * min() returns the minimum distance, max() returns the maximum distance
    * So calling this computeMST() returns the "iteration"
    *
    * so the matrix is ordered by the minimum distance
    * First column is the lesser of the index, second column is the greater index, and the third column is the distance
    *

   // This is the "steps" for single linked hierarchical clustering
   // This is computed by calling computeMST()
   Step 1. Construct the distance matrix from the given pattern matrix

    // there's a cor(x, y) function in arma
    // as long as it's in same dimension, arma can correlate vector or matrix.
   Step 2. Assign each pattern to a cluster

    // I think you can merge by calling cor(x, y) with vector returns the correlated vector
    // that contains the dot product
   Step 3. Determine the smallest entry in the distance matrix D, say D(c1, c2) and merge the
            two clusters c1 and c2

   Step 4. Update the distance matrix D, by deleting the row and column corresponding to
             the cluster c2, and rename row c1 and column c1 to (c1, c2).
            Assign the min[D(c3, c1), D(c3, c2)] to D(c3, (c1, c2)) and D((c1, c2), c3) for all c3â€™s

   Step 5. If only one cluster is left, stop. Else, go to Step 3
